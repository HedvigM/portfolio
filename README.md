This week i have learned to use some variables in the css code, i use it to refer to the main and the secondary colors. I have also learned a few trick in css, for example hov to use :nth-child(). Its very eciting to learn hos to make the css more efficient and how to use classes and combine them to make an overall thought through design. 

I struggled a bit with the fonts of the design, i had a hard time to recognize the different fonts from figma and what font should go where. 

I took myself some freedom in the coloring of the design to make it feel a bit more "me".
